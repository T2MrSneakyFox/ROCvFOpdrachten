        Game Rules
        <p class="gamerulestext">
          You have five dice which you can roll, represented by the die faces at
          the top of the applet window. To start with, you roll all dice by
          clicking on the Roll All button. After you roll all dice, you can
          either score the current roll, or re-roll any or all of the five dice.
          To re-roll some of the dice, click on the toggle button underneath the
          die face you want to re-roll, then click on the Re-roll button. This
          will re-roll the selected dice, leaving the unselected ones unchanged.
          You can roll the dice a total of three times the initial roll (in
          which you must roll all the dice), plus two re-rolls of any or all
          dice. After rolling three times, you must score the roll. Once you've
          scored the roll, you roll all the dice again and repeat the process.
          You continue until all 13 categories have been filled, at which time
          the game is over.
